5 Answer: C: 3
> The for each method's if condition is checking if the value is `truthy or falsy`. If the value is truthy the iteration will be executed else it'll not enter to the loop. in the nums variable there is 4 index and the value is 0 (which is falsy in JS), 1, 2, 3. So when loop variable runs for the first time it will get 0 that is falsy, so it'll now entered to to loop. For the rest of the element the loop will be executed. And the answer is C: 3.
